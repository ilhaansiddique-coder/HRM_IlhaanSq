## Item 2: ⚠️ UPDATE SUPABASE CREDENTIALS

**Status:** ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**

**Current Issue:**
Your `.env.local` file contains invalid Supabase credentials:
- ❌ `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is using a publishable key format (starts with `sb_publishable_`)
- ❌ Should be an anon key (starts with `eyJ...`)

**What you need to do:**

### Step 1: Get Your Anon Key
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/smopyfuaijaklmtpwgws
2. Navigate to: **Settings → API**
3. Copy the **anon/public** key (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Get Your Access Token
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Name it: "Rahestock Production"
4. Copy the token (starts with `sbp_...`)

### Step 3: Update `.env.local`
Replace the contents of `d:\Rahestock--Live\.env.local` with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://smopyfuaijaklmtpwgws.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<paste your anon key here>
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<paste your access token here>
```

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## Item 3: ⚠️ VERIFY RLS POLICIES

**Status:** ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**

**What is RLS?**
Row Level Security ensures users can only access data they're authorized to see. **Without RLS, anyone with your anon key can access ALL your database!**

**How to verify:**

### Quick Check (Dashboard)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/smopyfuaijaklmtpwgws
2. Click **Table Editor**
3. Look for shield icons (🛡️) next to table names
4. If you see "RLS disabled" warnings → **Enable RLS immediately!**

### Thorough Check (SQL)
1. Go to: **SQL Editor**
2. Run this query:
```sql
SELECT 
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```
3. Verify `rls_enabled` is `true` for ALL tables

### Critical Tables to Check
- ✅ `profiles`
- ✅ `user_roles`
- ✅ `products`
- ✅ `sales`
- ✅ `sale_items`
- ✅ `customers`
- ✅ `business_settings`
- ✅ `system_settings`

**📖 Detailed Guide:** See `RLS-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md`

## Item 4: ⚠️ HTTPS ENFORCEMENT

**Status:** ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**

**What you need to do:**

### If deploying to Vercel (Recommended):
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Login
vercel login

# 3. Deploy
vercel --prod

# 4. Set environment variables
vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_URL production
vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY production

# 5. Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

**Good news:** Vercel enforces HTTPS automatically! ✅

### If deploying to Netlify:
1. Create `netlify.toml` (see HTTPS-ENFORCEMENT-GUIDE.md)
2. Deploy via Netlify CLI or dashboard
3. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard

**Good news:** Netlify also enforces HTTPS automatically! ✅

### Verification:
After deployment, test:
1. Visit `http://yourdomain.com` → should redirect to `https://`
2. Check for padlock icon 🔒 in browser
3. Run SSL test: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
4. Target grade: **A or A+**

**📖 Detailed Guide:** See `HTTPS-ENFORCEMENT-GUIDE.md`
