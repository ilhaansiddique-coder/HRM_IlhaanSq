# Bulk Courier Status Refresh Feature

## ✅ Feature Added

A "Refresh All" button has been added to manually force refresh all courier statuses at once, with a warning popup before execution.

## 📍 Location

**Button Location:** Sales page header, next to the filters
- Desktop: Shows "Refresh All" text with refresh icon
- Mobile: Shows only the refresh icon
- Position: Between the user filter and the Sales Review toggle

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Click "Refresh All" Button**
- Located in the page header controls
- Shows a spinning icon when refreshing is in progress
- Disabled during refresh operation

### 2. **Warning Dialog Appears**
The dialog shows:
- ⚠️ Warning icon
- **Title:** "Refresh All Courier Statuses?"
- **Message:** 
  - "This will manually refresh the courier status for **all pending orders** with consignment IDs."
  - "Orders with final statuses (delivered, cancelled, returned, lost) will be skipped."
  - "This operation may take several minutes depending on the number of orders."
- **Buttons:**
  - **Cancel** - Closes the dialog without doing anything
  - **Refresh All** - Proceeds with the bulk refresh

### 3. **Bulk Refresh Process**
When you click "Refresh All":

1. **Fetches pending orders from current view:**
   - ✅ **Respects your current filters:**
     - Date range filter
     - Courier status filter
     - User filter
     - Search term
   - Gets only sales with consignment IDs
   - Excludes orders with final statuses:
     - ✅ delivered
     - ❌ cancelled
     - 🔄 returned
     - ❌ lost

2. **Refreshes each order:**
   - Calls the courier API for each order
   - Updates status in database
   - Logs activity for each update
   - Adds 1-second delay between requests (to avoid rate limiting)

3. **Shows progress:**
   - Initial toast: "Refreshing X order statuses..."
   - Console logs for each order
   - Final summary toast

4. **Completion:**
   - Success: "Successfully refreshed X order statuses"
   - Partial success: "Refreshed X orders, Y failed"
   - Refreshes the sales list automatically

## 🎯 Important: Respects Current Filters!

**The bulk refresh ONLY refreshes orders in your current view**, based on:
- 📅 **Date filter** - Only orders in the selected date range
- 🚚 **Courier status filter** - Only orders matching the selected status
- 👤 **User filter** - Only orders created by the selected user
- 🔍 **Search term** - Only orders matching your search

**Example scenarios:**
- If you filter by "February 2026", it will only refresh February orders
- If you filter by "sent" status, it will only refresh orders with "sent" status
- If you filter by a specific user, it will only refresh that user's orders
- If you search for a customer name, it will only refresh matching orders

This prevents accidentally refreshing thousands of old orders!
