# Courier Integration Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Notes Not Being Sent to Courier
**Problem**: The special instructions/notes entered in the courier dialog were not being saved to the database or displayed in the courier order details.

**Root Cause**: 
- The note was being sent correctly to the API (as `note` field)
- However, it wasn't being saved to the database after the order was created
- The `courier_notes` column didn't exist in the sales table

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Modified `CourierOrderDialog.tsx` to save the `special_instruction` to the `courier_notes` field when updating the sale
- ✅ Created migration file `20260211_add_courier_notes_to_sales.sql` to add the `courier_notes` column to the sales table
- ✅ The `CourierStatusDetails.tsx` component already displays the `courier_notes` field (lines 286-293)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/CourierOrderDialog.tsx` (lines 319-321)
- `supabase/migrations/20260211_add_courier_notes_to_sales.sql` (new file)

### 2. ✅ Icon Not Changing from Send Truck to Preview Courier Entry Details
**Problem**: After sending an order to the courier, the truck icon wasn't changing to the "View Details" icon (PackageSearch).

**Root Cause**: 
- The UI wasn't refreshing immediately after the order was created
- The `consignment_id` field update wasn't being reflected in the UI quickly enough

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Improved the refresh timing in `CourierOrderDialog.tsx`:
  - Close the dialog first
  - Then trigger a refresh event with a 100ms delay to ensure the dialog closes before the refresh
  - This ensures the parent component re-renders with the updated `consignment_id`
- ✅ The icon logic in `Sales.tsx` (lines 2328-2332 and 2431-2436) already checks for `sale.consignment_id` correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/CourierOrderDialog.tsx` (lines 332-340)

**How It Works**:
```typescript
// In Sales.tsx (already correct)
{sale.consignment_id ? (
  <PackageSearch className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600" /> // View Details icon
) : (
  <Truck className="h-4 w-4" /> // Send to Courier icon
)}
```

### 3. ✅ CN Number Not Syncing Automatically
**Problem**: The CN number field wasn't being updated automatically after sending the courier entry.

**Root Cause**: 
- The edge function was updating the `cn_number` field correctly
- However, the local update in `CourierOrderDialog.tsx` wasn't always working due to timing issues

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Ensured both the edge function and local update set the `cn_number` field
- ✅ Improved the courier status extraction from API response:
  - Extract status from Steadfast response: `result.status`
  - Extract status from Pathao response: `result.status`
  - Use the extracted status when updating the sale
- ✅ The edge function `steadfast-create-order/index.ts` already updates both `consignment_id` and `cn_number` (lines 174-175)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/CourierOrderDialog.tsx` (lines 266-340)

**How It Works**:
```typescript
// Extract status from API response
let courierStatus = 'in_review'; // Default
if (isSteadfast) {
  courierStatus = result.status || 'in_review';
}

// Update both consignment_id and cn_number
const updatePayload = {
  consignment_id: consignmentId,
  cn_number: consignmentId, // Same value
  courier_status: courierStatus,
  // ... other fields
};
```

## Database Migration Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You need to apply the database migration to add the `courier_notes` column.

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd d:\Rahestock--Live

# Apply the migration
supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution
If you don't have Supabase CLI, you can manually execute the SQL in the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the following SQL:

```sql
-- Add courier_notes column to sales table
ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS courier_notes TEXT;

-- Add comment to explain the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN sales.courier_notes IS 'Special instructions or notes sent to the courier service';
```

## Testing Checklist

After applying the migration, test the following:

### 1. Test Note Sending
- [ ] Create a new sale or edit an existing one
- [ ] Click the truck icon to send to courier
- [ ] Enter some text in the "Special Instructions" field
- [ ] Click "Send to [Courier Name]"
- [ ] After success, click the PackageSearch icon (should now be visible)
- [ ] Verify the notes appear in the "Courier Notes" section

### 2. Test Icon Change
- [ ] Create a new sale
- [ ] Verify the truck icon is visible (not sent yet)
- [ ] Click the truck icon and send to courier
- [ ] After success, verify the icon changes to PackageSearch (blue)
- [ ] Click the PackageSearch icon to view courier details

### 3. Test CN Number Sync
- [ ] Send a new order to courier
- [ ] After success, check the sales table
- [ ] Verify the CN Number column shows the consignment ID
- [ ] Click the PackageSearch icon
- [ ] Verify the CN Number is displayed in the courier details dialog

## Additional Notes

- The `courier_notes` field is optional and will only be displayed if it has a value
- The note is sent to the courier API as the `note` field
- The note is stored in the database as `courier_notes` for future reference

- The CN number is always synced with the `consignment_id` value
